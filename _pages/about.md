I am a passionate Ph.D. candidate at the Technical University of Munich. My academic journey began with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from FAU Erlangen-NÃ¼rnberg, followed by a Master's in Computational Linguistics from LMU Munich. My research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning, natural language processing, and multimodal AI, with a strong focus on fostering effective and ethical interactions between humans and intelligent systems.  

Before starting my Ph.D., I gained over five years of experience as a software developer at e.solutions GmbH, working on real-world applications in industry. During my Master's, I further honed my expertise as a research assistant, designing and teaching programming tutorials while supporting exam development. Now, in my Ph.D., I am excited to explore novel approaches to human-centered AI, combining insights from computational linguistics, federated learning, and privacy-enhancing technologies to create more inclusive and intelligent learning systems.
